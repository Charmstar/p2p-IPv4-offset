# p2p-IPv4-offset
Algorithm for an IP sender and an IP receiver to agree on an ESCAPE packet's TCP Checksum hex value and to establish an OFFSET hex value for receiver to translate subsequent TCP Checksums back to the sender's original intended two bytes per invalid TCP Checksum, regardless of port forwarding via NATs, if any.

ENCRYPTED FILE DELIVERY VIA SYNS ONLY, UNDER THE RADAR, TWO ENCRYPTED BYTES IN EACH SYN'S TCP CHECKSUM. LOOKS LIKE A SYN FLOOD ATTEMPT THAT UNAFFECTED
CENSORS PRESUMABLY CONTINUE TO DISREGARD AS SOMEBODY ELSE'S PROBLEM. INVALID TCP CHECKSUM PROTOCOL IS GOOD FROM USA TO ZHENGZHOU, CHINA AND BACK NOVEMBER 2021.
